# Stock Analysis with Excel and VBA

## Overview of project 

The purpose of this analysis was to make code quicker and more efficent. Also using stock information from 
the year 2017 and 2018 to determined weather or not stocks are worth investing. 

## Results

Based on the results of our analysis the data is cleraly indicating that the more succesful year was 2017. The data is
presented in two charts with information on two stocks within the each chart. The stock information contains a ticker 
value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and
the volume of the stock.

## Summary

Advantages of Refactoring Stock Code is the increase in macro run time. The orginial analysis took about one second
to run, my new analysis took about 1/4 of that (about .20 seconds) to run. Refactoring the code makes it a lot cleaner.
Making the design look better and cleaner the software improves, and it runs faster programming. It also most surely 
benefits any new user. Making it a lo easier to read. Some disadvantges would also include having applicatons to large
also messing with the proper code.
